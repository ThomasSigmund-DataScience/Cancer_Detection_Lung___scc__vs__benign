Lung Cancer Detection - Cancerous variant SCC  versus  benign tissue

This project analyzes an image dataset using a deep learning algorithm with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It utilizes the following Kaggle.com project:

Lung and Colon Cancer Histopathological Images Contains 25,000 images across 5 classes, including lung cancer, colon cancer, and healthy samples. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/lung-and-colon-cancer-histopathological-images

@STREAMLIT: To generate standalone Streamlit apps for each of the 5 cancer detection variants, five different repositories have been created. In each repository, the Python file (.py) and the model file (.sav) differ, while the Google Colab file (CANCER DETECTION WITH DEEP LEARNING.ipynb) and the requirements.txt file are identical.

Except for the initial two lines that differ among the 5 variants, THIS README.md file is similar to the other 4 sibling variants :)
